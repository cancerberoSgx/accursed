# TODO / questions / ideas / issues

JSX important: blessed elements (and custom subclasses)comply with Component (render() signature). class Custom extends blessed.widget.Box {...} ; React.render(<Custom/>)  should work out of the box.. fix createElement, ours:  render(): JSX.BlessedJsxNode - blessed:    render(): Coords

# Ideas

 *<Link>*  a special button with anchor like format that supportes an url... instea of a handler, there is a registry of paths, and a ROuter, and if the url matches the handler will show the page instead of the button havin to manipulate the nodes....!!!!
  - Like today's HTML apps nut in the console....
  * oths will match with apraemters... !!!
   * wmoji-search app : each tool and selection / option is represented with a url : `all/arabian/compact` or json like path ``{mainView: unicode, category: arabien, listType: compact, ect}`. This would simplify the app state a lot!!! that is missing in CLI apps development... 


 * app for change font family ?  Unicode has various fonts : mathematical script, franktur, double struc, sans serif, italic, monospace, and other strange : lisu letter  ... and we can use similars from cherokee. mathematical alphanumeric symbols
     * similar to previous : vertical text ? vertical forms, compatibilty forms
     * phonetic extensions  , also has
     * latin extended aditional - adds symbols below, on top of letters - could taken as effects ?
     * number forms : has formats for numbers... romans... 
     * enclosed alphnumerics
     enclosed ideographic
     * latin extended c
     * half width and full width forms

 * the same way we plan to implement ListTab or Tab using virtual to declare data in the markup - implement Markdown so it declare the markdown content as children and not as attribute.

 * since components are associatged to blessed elements, would it be useful to also associate elements to componetns ?
 * props.children typings
 * shuld we support also blessed-contrib ? here ? another project?
 //TODO: research: to work purely with data / options and not with the elements already instantiated, we should create an intermediary representation  n createElement() and only create the blessed elements in render() so we have the time to process the option/tree before calling blessed constructors. for exapmle propagate style plugin is costly because it manipultes the elements instead of options AFTER they are rendered.... 
  * for state / update we will have the same problem as with jsx-alone-dom ex: .we want to represetn focus, hover, etc with component state and update the state. two alternatives:. Other ex: user center text of select an optionor etc - this will require components to be updated. 

RESEARCH PROBLEM -
   * an option here that we dont ahve in dom is, because we can assume that elemeents in terminal are much kess, we can associate a Component instance to EACH native elemnt so and this take care of the update. 

   Stateless (recreating the whole thing like with virtual dom is not viable here I think.)

   * don't ise blessed effects amd implement it from scrach


# Issues

 * this is failing :   return <Div height="100%" width="100%">
      {[1,2,3,4,4,3,3,3,3].map(d=><button content="helo"/>)}
    </Div>
 * feature: jsx screen
 * feature: a provider for common props so style is propagated and mixed in childern
 * feature: refs ?   

# TODO 
 

 * IDEA: jsx render implementations are "forced" to consume the ast frmo the children to the parent (becase mostly of how the getberated fnuction call expressions are evaluated). But in gereal the mediums support first creating the parent and THEN creating and appending the children so this is the crazy idea. Instead of genrerating function expressoin calls generate a similar structure, and before rendering (React.render()) REVERSE the TREE. then render it upside down, level by level in order.  And It should be mandatory to generate an intermediate representation. The function calls can bewrapped in other function calls (instead of `h('div',{}, [h()])` generate  `(()=>h('div',{}, [()=>h())]))`  (similar how behavior JSX tahs like <If> are implemented... so they dont hget evaluated.
  * try to implement this in a second implementation or "mode" for blessed to see if this  easy the poroblem of plugins.

 * screen this.tput.bools.back_color_eraseÏ€ - from screen - add to API?
