# TODO / questions / ideas / issues

 - [ ] feature: jsx screen
 - [ ] feature: a provider for common props so style is propagated and mixed in childern
 - [x] feature: refs ?   
 - [ ] this is failing :   `  return <Div height="100%" width="100%">    {[1,2,3,4,4,3,3,3,3].map(d=><button content="helo"/>)}    </Div>`
- [ ] developer a clean APi for focus, scroll with well defined behavior 
 - [ ] probably define a syntax on top of blessed since it behave badly
 - [ ] **MAKE SURE** all components implemented here support this common base of options (probably inheriting from the same base)
 - [ ] blessed API design is OK but it won't work
 - [ ] support js and jsx OOTB
- [ ] mode-managers like in flor: 
   * refined event manager
   * first event layer for modes
     * for example a focus mode to use arrows to easily directional focus
     * other focus mode that assign letters (shortcuts) to all visible focusables and show these letters
   * on of these modes (NAME-HERE) will enable events on "native" components
   * api for focus control so actors can prevent/allow focus on other with API
   * API to defining new modes
   * probably we will need to hack Screen
   * secondfocus-mode : another implementation of focus manager. 
- [ ] FileSelector : {baseFolder, patterns: [*.txt], allowSelectFolders: boolean, multiple: boolean} 
  - [ ] also allow a recursive experience, if gicen a pattern users can choose a folder and we glob() all inner files that match
- [ ] move editor-widget to a separate project accursed-editor-widget - - or peed dependency
- [ ] move all blessed-contrib related stuff to a separate project to remove its dependency - or peed dependency




# Ideas


JSX important: blessed elements (and custom subclasses)comply with Component (render() signature). class Custom extends blessed.widget.Box {...} ; React.render(<Custom/>)  should work out of the box.. fix createElement, ours:  render(): JSX.BlessedJsxNode - blessed:    render(): Coords

## Router

 *<Link>- [ ]  a special button with anchor like format that supportes an url... instea of a handler, there is a registry of paths, and a ROuter, and if the url matches the handler will show the page instead of the button havin to manipulate the nodes....!!!!
  - Like today's HTML apps nut in the console....
  - [ ] oths will match with apraemters... !!!
   - [ ] wmoji-search app : each tool and selection / option is represented with a url : `all/arabian/compact` or json like path ``{mainView: unicode, category: arabien, listType: compact, ect}`. This would simplify the app state a lot!!! that is missing in CLI apps development... 

## jsx performance

 * IDEA: jsx render implementations are "forced" to consume the ast frmo the children to the parent (becase mostly of how the getberated fnuction call expressions are evaluated). But in gereal the mediums support first creating the parent and THEN creating and appending the children so this is the crazy idea. Instead of genrerating function expressoin calls generate a similar structure, and before rendering (React.render()) REVERSE the TREE. then render it upside down, level by level in order.  And It should be mandatory to generate an intermediate representation. The function calls can bewrapped in other function calls (instead of `h('div',{}, [h()])` generate  `(()=>h('div',{}, [()=>h())]))`  (similar how behavior JSX tahs like <If> are implemented... so they dont hget evaluated.
  * try to implement this in a second implementation or "mode" for blessed to see if this  easy the poroblem of plugins.

 * screen this.tput.bools.back_color_eraseÏ€ - from screen - add to API?



 - [ ] (NOT POSSIBLE almost sure because JSX "standard" will trim spaces in between) : the same way we plan to implement ListTab or Tab using virtual to declare data in the markup - implement Markdown so it declare the markdown content as children and not as attribute.
 - [ ] since components are associated to blessed elements, would it be useful to also associate elements to componetns ?
 - [ ] props.children typings
 - [ ] //TODO: research: to work purely with data / options and not with the elements already instantiated, we should create an intermediary representation  n createElement() and only create the blessed elements in render() so we have the time to process the option/tree before calling blessed constructors. for exapmle propagate style plugin is costly because it manipulates the elements instead of options AFTER they are rendered.... 
  - [ ] for state / update we will have the same problem as with jsx-alone-dom ex: .we want to represetn focus, hover, etc with component state and update the state. two alternatives:. Other ex: user center text of select an optionor etc - this will require components to be updated. 

### RESEARCH PROBLEM -

   - [ ] an option here that we dont have in dom is, because we can assume that elements in terminal are much kess, we can associate a Component instance to EACH native elemnt so and this take care of the update. 

   Stateless (recreating the whole thing like with virtual dom is not viable here I think.)

   - [x] don't ise blessed effects amd implement it from scrach - DONE see flor


# doubts / thoughts about JSX Text implementation,

....blessing, performance, design ...  need feedback ... 

Observations on the actual implementation

 * behaves well  with layout="inline" 
 * respect the JSX code AST structure text is a child node, not an attribute)
 * more natural to format using tags (<H1>hello <strong>ksksks</strong>asdasd<i>ajlshd</i>
 * I think is a limiation that a button dont have children. many children  are hardcoded internally as nodes (border, hover, 
  * label. Maybe that's good for perfoamnce.. but is a limiatation... 
 
It can be easily changed, but I'n not sure since that will change the structure....

 * The implementation is isolated in React.[[createTextNode]] method so is easily customizable.  
 
* Probably will be configurable* because of performance TODO: performance? use another thing ? use content? join several JSXText in one ?  

**TO DECIDE WHILE IM PLAYING WITH IT** *right now it behaves well with layouts.. perhaps content='' is better. or text?

 * styles could be adapted from blessed like its options and modeled with classhierarchies, but also try to create a new feature and see how it plays there. For example a new option in ComponentWithOptions called cursor (since all elements should support it and don't)
